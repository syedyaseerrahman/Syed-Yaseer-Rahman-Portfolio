# Derivatives Pricing & Trading

This project applies quantitative methods to the valuation and risk analysis of S&P 500 futures and options, combining theoretical models, stochastic processes, and empirical validation.

## Scope
- Analysed index, ETF, futures, and option data (SPX and SPY) from 2010–2020.  
- Examined consistency between market prices and theoretical relationships across instruments.  
- Simulated option strategies and assessed portfolio performance under live-trading conditions.  

## Methods
- **Put–Call Parity:** Derived implied asset prices, interest rates, and dividend yields; tested for arbitrage.  
- **Option Pricing Models:**  
  - Binomial trees for SPX and SPY option valuation.  
  - Black–Scholes model and Monte Carlo simulation under GBM.  
- **Volatility Estimation:**  
  - Implied volatility surfaces and volatility smiles.  
  - Historical volatility, conditional volatility with GARCH(1,1) and EWMA.  
- **Stochastic Processes:** Simulated index dynamics using Wiener, Generalised Wiener, and Geometric Brownian Motion.  
- **Risk Sensitivities:** Analysed option Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho) to interpret price changes and risk exposures.  
- **Trading Simulation:** Constructed and evaluated derivative portfolios, measuring returns and risk-adjusted performance.  

## Tools
- **R:** Option pricing, Monte Carlo simulation, volatility modelling, and trading strategy evaluation.  
- **Statistical Libraries:** Time series and econometric packages for GARCH, EWMA, and stochastic process simulations.  
- **Excel/Visualisation:** Validation of pricing models and graphical analysis of volatility and Greeks.
