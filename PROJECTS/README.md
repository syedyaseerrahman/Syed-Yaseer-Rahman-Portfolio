# ðŸ“‚ Projects Portfolio

This repository hosts a selection of academic and applied projects across **credit risk**, **derivatives**, and **financial data analytics**. Each project demonstrates practical implementation of quantitative models, governance frameworks, and forecasting techniques widely used in finance and risk management.

## ðŸ”¹ Credit Risk Modelling
- Built **Altman Z-Score** and **Merton structural default** models in Excel to estimate **PD, LGD, and EAD** under Basel III/IFRS 9.  
- Designed **stress-testing frameworks** to evaluate bond suitability, covenant compliance, and capital adequacy.  
- Produced peer-firm credit reports integrating variance testing and risk indicators for **investment decision support**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Derivatives & Quantitative Finance
- Developed **option pricing and volatility models** using Blackâ€“Scholesâ€“Merton, Binomial Trees, and Monte Carlo simulations.  
- Applied **GARCH and EWMA** for volatility forecasting and derivative risk assessment.  
- Validated models against **S&P futures and ETFs**, achieving **1st place in the CME Trading Challenge**.  
- Designed **sensitivity and hedging frameworks** to evaluate portfolio exposures under varying market conditions.

## ðŸ”¹ Data Analytics & Forecasting
- Applied **ARIMA, GARCH, Support Vector Regression, Neural Networks, and Reinforcement Learning** to forecast long-horizon EPS time series.  
- Designed pipelines for **feature engineering, validation, and performance benchmarking** across econometric and ML models.  
- Automated analytics and governance reporting in **Quarto**, integrating scenario/sensitivity testing and model diagnostics.  
- Generated comparative outputs demonstrating **forecast accuracy and robustness across methods**.

## ðŸ”¹ Valuation & Financial Modelling
- Built integrated **DCF and ratio-based valuation models** incorporating financial statement projections, variance analysis, and sensitivity testing.  
- Applied **Monte Carlo simulations** to model FX exposure and cost drivers in **enterprise risk management**.  
- Developed scenario analyses to capture valuation ranges under **bull, base, and bear market assumptions**.
