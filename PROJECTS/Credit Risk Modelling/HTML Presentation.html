      <p><strong>1. Purpose &amp; Coverage</strong><br>
      - We compare five global retailers—Walmart and Costco (US), Alibaba (China), Carrefour (Europe + partial LatAm), and Magazine Luiza (Brazil)—spanning 2019–2024.<br>
      - This timeframe captures pre-/post-pandemic changes, e-commerce surges, interest rate hikes, and the shift toward omnichannel retailing.<br>
      - We use Altman Z-Scores (structural solvency) plus Merton Distance to Default (market-driven default probability) to see how stable vs. emerging markets shape credit risk.
      </p>
      <p><strong>2. Why These Metrics</strong><br>
      - As credit analysts, we look at working capital usage, debt/EBITDA norms, margin stability, and each region’s macro environment.</p>

    <div class="speaker-notes">
      <p><strong>1. Economic Background</strong><br>
      - Walmart &amp; Costco operate in the US: relatively stable, albeit rising labor costs and fierce competition from Amazon.<br>
      - Alibaba contends with China’s regulatory environment (data privacy, fintech oversight) plus geopolitical tensions.<br>
      - Carrefour in Europe faces low consumer spending growth and discount store competition, tries offsetting it via Latin America expansions.<br>
      - Magazine Luiza in Brazil benefits from digital adoption, but 13.75% interest rates inflate borrowing costs significantly.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Convergence/Divergence from Ratings?</strong><br>
      - Both US firms (Walmart/Costco) hold high ratings (AA / A+), aligned with stable macro conditions and strong domestic demand.<br>
      - Alibaba: A+ rating partially reflects large scale &amp; liquidity, but local regulatory pressure could diverge from rating agencies’ optimism if those clampdowns worsen.<br>
      - Carrefour: BBB rating suggests moderate caution in line with Europe’s maturity.<br>
      - Mag. Luiza: BB- rating converges with Brazil’s volatile macro; high interest rates hamper expansions, thus justifying a speculative grade.</p>

    <div class="speaker-notes">
      <p><strong>1. Comparative Industry Overview</strong><br>
      - Walmart: Largest retailer by revenue (~$648B). Scale advantage fosters lower unit costs but demands capital to remain tech-competitive.<br>
      - Costco: Membership-driven revenue confers stable income, supporting credit strength. E-commerce is smaller but growing.<br>
      - Alibaba: E-commerce + cloud in China, stiff local rivalry, with historically high margins (though falling).<br>
      - Carrefour: Big in a “mature, low-growth” Europe market. Digital efforts lag behind pure-play e-commerce leaders.<br>
      - Magazine Luiza: Rapid digital expansions in Brazil, financed with debt, raising risk in a high-rate environment.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Why These Five?</strong><br>
      - We wanted to see if volatile markets (China, Brazil) produce bigger divergences between actual performance and credit ratings vs. stable US/EU players.<br>
      - Also, to highlight how omnichannel or membership models affect credit metrics (Costco, Walmart) versus pure e-commerce (Alibaba, Mag. Luiza).</p>

    <div class="speaker-notes">
      <p>
        This table addresses our hypothesis: Volatile markets (China, Brazil) often show bigger rating-performance gaps. 
        Alibaba has some mismatch (strong rating vs declining Altman). Magazine Luiza’s distressed numbers do match a low rating, 
        reinforcing high volatility’s risk. Meanwhile, stable US players like Walmart and Costco exhibit minimal divergences. 
        Carrefour is semi-stable in Europe, bridging both sides with a moderate rating (BBB).

      <p><strong>1. Governance Observations</strong><br>
      - Walmart: Family ownership fosters strategic consistency but raises questions about minority influence. Credited with strong ESG.<br>
      - Costco: Standard US governance; membership accountability fosters stable performance.<br>
      - Alibaba: Partnership structure can expedite decisions but faces Chinese state constraints.<br>
      - Carrefour: Cross-national oversight is complex, margin improvement strategies crucial.<br>
      - Magazine Luiza: Founder/family leadership spurred rapid digital transformations, but big leverage calls into question risk oversight.</p>

      <p><strong>2. Justification &amp; Rating Reflection</strong><br>
      - Walmart: Large ESG push and scale synergy align with its high rating (AA).<br>
      - Costco: Transparent board fosters consistent profitability, matching A+ rating.<br>
      - Alibaba: Intangible partnership governance might diverge from A+ rating if regulatory clampdowns intensify.<br>
      - Carrefour: Multi-national complexity partly justifies BBB rating (moderate risk).<br>
      - Mag. Luiza: Family leadership with high leverage is riskier, matching BB- profile.</p>

    <div class="speaker-notes">
      <p><strong>1. Profitability &amp; Efficiency</strong><br>
      - Alibaba: Remarkably high margins vs. typical low-margin retail. But net margin fell from ~18.5% in 2019 to 13.6% (2024) amid regulatory fines, local competition.<br>
      - Costco: Lean cost structure + membership turnover → top ROE (26.4%). This synergy supports consistent credit performance, converging with A+ rating.<br>
      - Walmart: 2.4% net margin is standard for a broadline retailer, invests heavily to remain e-commerce-competitive. ROE ~17.2% consistent with scale advantage.<br>
      - Carrefour &amp; Mag. Luiza: Both sub-2% net margin. Their lower profitability indicates vulnerability to margin shocks, partly explaining lower ratings (BBB, BB-).</p>

      <p><strong>2. DuPont Justifications</strong><br>
      - Costco merges high asset turnover (~2.3) with moderate equity multiplier =&gt; best ROE in the group, aligning with rating agencies’ positivity.<br>
      - Alibaba has strong net margin but a meager asset turnover (0.6). Mismatch yields ~12.8% ROE, reflecting intangible cloud assets.<br>
      - <strong>Walmart</strong>: Balanced synergy of moderate asset turnover (1.4) and scale-based margin. ROE near 17% → stable, supporting AA rating.<br>
      - <strong>Carrefour</strong>: Lower margin + moderate asset turnover (1.2) hamper ROE (~9.5%), consistent with a BBB rating that acknowledges modest returns in a mature market.<br>
      - Mag. Luiza’s decent turnover (1.8) is offset by tiny margin (0.6%), weakening returns and credit stance.</p>

      - Walmart &amp; Costco: Lower CR but quick turnover → consistent with high ratings, reflecting stable cash flows.<br>
      - Carrefour &amp; Mag. Luiza: Near or below 1.0 CR, reliant on short-term financing. Heightens vulnerability if market conditions tighten, supporting BBB or BB- stances.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Solvency</strong><br>
      - Walmart/Costco/Alibaba maintain modest Debt/EBITDA (1.4–1.7) and robust coverage (8.5x–11x–10x), aligning with AA/A+ ratings.<br>
      - Carrefour (2.5x, coverage 3.8x) and Mag. Luiza (3.6x, 1.2x) reflect higher leverage and weaker coverage. Lower margins intensify default risk, explaining BBB or BB-.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Convergence/Divergence</strong><br>
      - <strong>Walmart</strong>: Clearly convergent; stable leverage, high coverage → AA is justified.<br>
      - <strong>Costco</strong>: Minimal leverage risk, membership synergy → A+ is consistent.<br>
      - <strong>Alibaba</strong>: Impressive liquidity helps sustain A+, despite potential regulatory drag.<br>
      - <strong>Carrefour</strong>: Weaker structural metrics but short-term coverage → BBB stands.<br>

      - Walmart &amp; Costco see tight bond spreads, consistent with stable OCF and proven retail models.<br>
      - Alibaba trades at lower yields than a mid-level altman might suggest—investors prize brand scale &amp; liquidity.<br>
      - Carrefour’s wider spreads reflect caution around EU discount battles, but short-term coverage sustains BBB.<br>
      - Mag. Luiza sees high yields, aligning with near-distress risk.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Cash Flow</strong><br>
      - Walmart invests heavily in technology; consistent FCF underpins stable rating.<br>
      - Alibaba’s strong e-commerce OCF partially offset by regulatory fines and intangible expansions.<br>
      - Costco’s membership-based approach ensures stable OCF, though margins can be narrower.<br>
      - Carrefour &amp; Mag. Luiza both face debt constraints plus relatively low OCF, which strains expansions if conditions worsen.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Industry Norms</strong><br>
      - Many large retailers aim for ~1–2x Debt/EBITDA and ~2–5% net margins as a safe zone.<br>
      - <strong>Walmart</strong> stays comfortably in these bounds.<br>
      - <strong>Costco</strong> surpasses typical efficiency norms (membership loyalty).<br>
      - <strong>Alibaba</strong> outperforms typical margins, but intangible/regulatory aspects complicate risk.<br>
      - <strong>Carrefour</strong> lags in margin stability, edging it closer to BBB territory.<br>
      - <strong>Mag. Luiza</strong> sits below healthy thresholds (leverage ~3.6x, net margin ~0.6%), consistent with a BB- credit stance.

      <p><strong>1. Synthesis</strong><br>
      - Walmart &amp; Costco: Both altman and merton confirm minimal default risk; rating agencies’ high grades (AA, A+) converge with these models.<br>
      - Alibaba: Shows a moderate mismatch—A+ vs. a 2.80 altman. Rating agencies emphasize intangible brand value, large liquidity, overshadowing structural signals.<br>
      - Carrefour: Converges moderately with BBB; near-zero immediate default from Merton but altman suggests deeper fragility if macro or cost shocks occur.<br>
      - Mag. Luiza: Z=1.42, Merton=2.12 → high risk, matching the BB- rating (speculative).</p>

      <p><strong>2. Integrating Rating Methodology, ESG, &amp; Macro</strong><br>
      - Agencies often prioritize free cash flow or intangible brand equity. For instance, Alibaba’s brand strength helps maintain A+ despite a downward-trending altman.<br>
      - ESG factors: Walmart invests in sustainable supply chains; Carrefour has carbon-reduction targets. When effective, ESG can reduce long-term operational risks and stabilize credit profiles.<br>
      - Macroeconomic cycles (e.g., 2019–2024 disruptions, US–China tensions, high Brazilian rates) shaped expansions for Mag. Luiza or regulatory pressures for Alibaba. Ratings weigh if these shocks are transitory or structural.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Final Observations</strong><br>
      - Safe Investment Grade: Walmart, Costco’s minimal risk confirmed by strong altman, stable debt metrics, synergy with the US market.<br>
      - Moderate Outlook: Alibaba’s intangible strengths keep A+ afloat, but altman signals caution; Carrefour’s short-term liquidity anchors BBB despite low structural scores.<br>
      - High Distress: Magazine Luiza’s expansions in a volatile environment hamper default metrics, consistent with BB- speculation.

        In this slide, we see <strong>Walmart</strong> and <strong>Costco</strong> firmly in the green zone for Altman and Merton, though their current ratios are moderate. This synergy supports their top-tier credit ratings. 
        <strong>Alibaba</strong> has moderate structural metrics yet strong liquidity and net margin, reflecting intangible brand influence. 
        <strong>Carrefour</strong> shows weaker altman and margin, but moderate Merton and CR to manage near-term obligations. 
        <strong>Mag. Luiza</strong> is near risk thresholds across multiple metrics, reinforcing its high-risk credit category.

      <p>
        This table consolidates each firm’s structural (Altman), market-driven (Merton), liquidity (CR), and profitability (Net Margin) measures into one visual reference. 
        It highlights why <strong>Walmart</strong> and <strong>Costco</strong> remain investment-grade (safe synergy), 
        how <strong>Alibaba</strong> balances moderate caution with strong brand and liquidity, 
        why <strong>Carrefour</strong> sustains a moderate BBB rating through short-term coverage, 
        and how <strong>Mag. Luiza</strong> reflects speculative distress in a volatile Brazilian context.
