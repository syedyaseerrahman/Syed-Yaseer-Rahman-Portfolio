# Credit Risk Modelling

This project applies credit risk measurement techniques to assess default probabilities and portfolio exposures.  

## Key Components
- **Default Risk Models:** Implemented Altman Z-score and Merton structural model in Excel to estimate firm-level creditworthiness.  
- **PD, LGD, EAD Estimation:** Applied probability of default, loss given default, and exposure at default metrics under Basel III / IFRS 9 context.  
- **Stress Testing:** Conducted scenario and sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of adverse shocks on solvency and coverage ratios.  
- **Variance & Ratio Analysis:** Linked outputs to structured portfolio performance reports, aligning results with sector benchmarks.
